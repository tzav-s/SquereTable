# SquereTable
A program that will read a number M (int) and a number N (int) and then
will read the MxN (rows x columns) elements (long) of a two-dimensional array A. The maximum dimension
table A is 100x100, ie the user will use part of table A and consider that
user always gives M and N less than 100. Then he will calculate and display the
sums of the elements of each row and column. If the table entered by the user is
square (M = N) then will display the sum of the two diagonals.

The output will display the table elements and in each row the sum of the row, while in each
column the sum of the column
