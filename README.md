 The E.M.Y. records every 8 hours the temperatures of 10 cities of Greece (the names of the cities are
coded with numbers: 0 = Thessaloniki, 1 = Athens etc). Write a program that will read them

of 8 o'clock,
1
of 8 o'clock, 2
8 hours for each city). Then calculate and display:
 the national average temperature (double variable) and
ï‚§ for each city its average temperature and its maximum deviation from the national average
(double type variables)
